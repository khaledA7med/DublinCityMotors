                    At DCM, we trust in German engineering. Our passion for these elegantly powerful machines goes back
                    more than 30 years. What started as a fascination became a full-time profession – buying and selling
                    the favorite cars of automotive enthusiasts worldwide. <br><br>

                    Starting out with focus on iconic gems such as the BMW E30, Audi Ur Quattro, and VW Golf GTI from
                    the golden era of the 80s and 90s, we now source nearly new, low-mileage, highly maintained cars for
                    today’s Audi and BMW car enthusiasts. <br><br>

                    DCM, founded in 2015, is the culmination of years spent supplying the Irish market with high-spec
                    UK-imported cars. Today, DCM brings its expertise to sourcing cars worldwide, catering to those
                    seeking the epitome of performance, style, and craftsmanship in German automobiles. <br><br>

                    As a luxury car boutique, what sets us apart is not merely the stunning cars we offer, but also the
                    personalized experience we provide. At DCM, we understand that each customer is unique and finding
                    their dream vehicle an easy and enjoyable journey is our specialty.
